##  Why This Project Stands Out

This was a **client-facing project** where I collaborated closely with the stakeholder to:
- Translate design requirements into functional code
- Ensure cross-device compatibility and performance
- Deliver on time with clear communication throughout

It demonstrates my ability to **ship production-ready work for real users**, not just personal projects.
